				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">I didn’t sign up, but I still want to go. Is that OK?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>If possible, we would like as many folks as possible to sign-up in advance. However, people coming day of are of course welcomed. The one catch is if there is no room inside, we may ask you to wait a little bit, but we’re hoping that it won’t get too overcrowded. The space is pretty big so it shouldn’t be a problem!!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What if I signed up but I can’t make it? Can I get my money back?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>We’ll miss you for sure, however, we will sadly be unable to refund your money. However, know that your sign-up fee will go to a good cause. As a reminder, all money raised will be split between Planned Parenthood and She Should Run.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Will there be changing rooms?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>There should be one or two changing areas. However, we strongly recommend that you come wearing a tank top and leggings in case you need to try things on in the open.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">I like treats!</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>That’s not a question, but we’ll let it slide because we do as well! We will have some (a limited amount of) wine and snacks on hand and set up in the kitchen. Please feel free to bring some snacks or drinks to share with your fellow fashionistas and help create a fun and homey environment!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Do you need help setting up the swap?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Boy, do we! We’d love some in fact. If you’re able to help, please FB message JJ Jackson or email her at <a href="mailto:jenniferjackson33@gmail.com">jenniferjackson33@gmail.com</a>, and let her know. </p>

			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Do you need help breaking down the swap?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>BOY DO WE!! We especially need help transporting leftover clothes from the location of the swap to a local organization we are donating to. If you are able to help, please sign up on the sign up form or please FB message JJ Jackson or email her at <a href="mailto:jenniferjackson33@gmail.com">jenniferjackson33@gmail.com</a>, and let her know.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Is it too late to donate clothes?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>NOPE! In fact, we’d love some more clothes. Donation details can be found <a href="#drop-off">below</a>. Ideally, we’d love to get as many clothes in advance of the swap as possible so things are set up. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Can I donate mirrors, hangers or clothing racks?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Yes please! We could definitely use more mirrors and clothing racks. In addition, if you have easy-to-set-up bookshelves, that would also be helpful to fold clothes on.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">Can I leave without paying? I am great with IOUs!</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>We’re sure you are, but we don’t want to track anyone down. Ergo, no one can leave without paying for their clothes. We will be accepting cash, PayPal and Venmo.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">OK, this is all helpful. In summary, what should I bring?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>We like things in lists, too, so here goes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A bag to bring home your treasures in.</li>
						<li>Small bills if you’re planning on paying in cash. </li>
						<li>Your smartphone if you intend to pay via paypal or venmo. (preferred!)</li>
						<li>A snack or wine to share.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>And a reminder to wear leggings and a tank top for ease of trying on clothes. </p>
					<p>As always, if you have any questions, please FB message JJ Jackson, post on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/202500151128035/" target="_blank">FB invite</a> or email JJ at <a href="mailto:jenniferjackson33@gmail.com">jenniferjackson33@gmail.com</a>.</p>

			<h3>Clothing Drop Off Deets</h3>
			<h4>Have clothing you want to get rid of?! GREAT! We would love to take them!  Check out the FAQ below, as well as information on where and when to drop off clothes!</h4>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What are you looking for?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>We are seeking women's clothing of any size.  <em>These clothes should be gently worn (no giant holes or stains, etc), and laundered.</em></p>
					<p>We are also looking to collect accessories (purses, shoes, jewelry, belts, scarves, etc).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">But I can't make the swap.  Do you still want my clothes?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>OF COURSE!  We'd love to take your stuff off your hands!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">What will you do with the clothing after the swap?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>All clothes at the end of the swap will be donated to a local organization.  If you would like to volunteer to take a load of clothing, please indicate this on the sign up sheet.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">How do I donate?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>Great! We'd thought you'd never ask.  Please place all clothing (folded nicely) in bags separated into the following categories:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Skirts</li>
						<li>Pants/shorts</li>
						<li>Dresses</li>
						<li>Tops</li>
						<li>Sweaters</li>
						<li>Jackets</li>
						<li>Business suits</li>
						<li>Accessories</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Please label the outside of the bag with both the category and the size.</strong>  So for example, one bag would say, "Skirts, sizes L to XL."  Another bag would be "Sweaters, sizes XL to 2X."  Please try to lump clothing in similarish sizes.  (So put small tops in a different bag than XXL tops).  This will help to expedite the day-of set up.</p>
					<p>Please make sure shoes have the size on there somewhere.  (You can always add a post-it note in the shoe if it's not readable on there).</p>
				</div>
			</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
				<div class="faq-question">I also have a ton of hangers and racks.  Interested?</div>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>OH YES!!!  We very much need hangers, clothing racks, mirrors, and shelves to display clothes!  You can drop off all of these items at the below locations as well.  NOTE: getting clothes and hangers BEFORE the event itself is a huge help.</p>
				</div>
