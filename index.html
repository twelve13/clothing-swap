		<h3>Have clothing you want to get rid of?! GREAT! We would love to take them!  Check out the FAQ below, as well as information on where and when to drop off clothes!</h3>
		<div class="faq-item">
			<div class="faq-question">What are you looking for?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				<p>We are seeking women's clothing of any size.  <em>These clothes should be gently worn (no giant holes or stains, etc), and laundered.</em></p>
				<p>We are also looking to collect accessories (purses, shoes, jewelry, belts, scarves, etc).</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-item">
			<div class="faq-question">But I can't make the swap.  Do you still want my clothes?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				<p>OF COURSE!  We'd love to take your stuff off your hands!</p>
			</div>
		</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
			<div class="faq-question">What will you do with the clothing after the swap?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				<p>All clothes at the end of the swap will be donated to a local organization.  If you would like to volunteer to take a load of clothing, please indicate this on the sign up sheet.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-item">
			<div class="faq-question">How do I donate?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				<p>Great! We'd thought you'd never ask.  Please place all clothing (folded nicely) in bags separated into the following categories:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Skirts</li>
					<li>Pants/shorts</li>
					<li>Dresses</li>
					<li>Tops</li>
					<li>Sweaters</li>
					<li>Jackets</li>
					<li>Business suits</li>
					<li>Accessories</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Please label the outside of the bag with both the category and the size.</strong>  So for example, one bag would say, "Skirts, sizes L to XL."  Another bag would be "Sweaters, sizes XL to 2X."  Please try to lump clothing in similarish sizes.  (So put small tops in a different bag than XXL tops).  This will help to expedite the day-of set up.</p>
				<p>Please make sure shoes have the size on there somewhere.  (You can always add a post-it note in the shoe if it's not readable on there).</p>
			</div>
		</div>
			<div class="faq-item">
			<div class="faq-question">I also have a ton of hangers and racks.  Interested?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer">
				<p>OH YES!!!  We very much need hangers, clothing racks, mirrors, and shelves to display clothes!  You can drop off all of these items at the below locations as well.  NOTE: getting clothes and hangers BEFORE the event itself is a huge help.</p>
			</div>
